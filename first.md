# fist post
HiðŸ˜„, Iâ€™m a web developer in training, a photographer by passion, a designer by curiosity, and a wine sommelier by taste.
I love to create things from scratchâ€”whether it's code, photos, or my own wine pairings.
Join me on my journey as I dive into the world of tech and design, one project at a time!
